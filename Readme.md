This project explores various clinical scenarios on top of various middleware
via [a basic set of communication
patterns](https://bitbucket.org/rvprasad/clinical-scenarios/downloads/mdd4ms.pdf).

## Components

* *simple-communication-patterns* contains the API, SPI, and reference
  implementation of the proposed communication patterns.
* *clinical-scenarios* contains implementations of clinical scenarios using
  both the native API of communication substrates (such as DDS) and the above
  patterns based API.
